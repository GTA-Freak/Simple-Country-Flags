# About

This is a filterscript for GTA SA:MP, short for Grand Theft Auto - San Andreas Multiplayer, a video game by Rockstar Games. It allows you to show the flag of a country in-game. You can use a simple dialog to choose from a bunch of available countries (see below for a full list). The flags will be shown as a Textdraw for a certain time that you can set by yourself.

# Changelog

Please see the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md) for a full list of changes.

# List of all available countries

# Notes

* Unfortunately the flag of Armenia, India and Niger is not correct because orange is not available to use. I have replaced it with yellow so the flag can be listed here.
